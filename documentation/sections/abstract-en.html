<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Annotation Objects ontology aims to represent the annotations produced during the development of a building renovation project. These
annotations serve to inform about issues or missing information that could be relevant for the project, such as indicating that a building
element is missing in the BIM model.
